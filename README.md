***Expense Tracker***
This Expense Tracker is a React-based application powered by a JSON Server backend that helps users easily manage and track their personal expenses. It allows users to securely sign up, log in, and keep track of their expenses with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Additionally, the app visualizes expenses through a dynamic pie chart, providing insights into spending habits.

Delete Expense: Users can remove an expense entry from their tracker.

**Visualization**
Pie Chart: Expenses are visually represented using a dynamic pie chart, allowing users to categorize and analyze their spending patterns effectively.
Backend
